So  I have  to  code  the  following files : config/db.js , models/User.js, models/Content.js, models/subscription.js, routes/auth.js, routes/content.js, routes/subscription.js, controllers/authController.js, controllers/contentControllers.js, controllers/subscriptionController.js, middleware/auth.js, .env, server.js . 


So  we are going  to use;  node.js, MongoDB, Paystack. Create  a  folder ‘motivational-content-website’ . Then  in the terminal run;  ‘npm init -y’ , ‘npm install express mongoose bycrptjs jsonwebtoken dotenv  cors  body-parser multer paystack-api’ . 

1. npm init -y
npm: This stands for Node Package Manager, which is a default package manager for Node.js. It allows you to install libraries and manage packages for your Node.js projects.

init: This command initializes a new Node.js project. It creates a package.json file, which is essential for any Node.js application. The package.json file contains metadata about the project, including its name, version, dependencies, scripts, and more.

-y: This flag stands for "yes." When you run npm init without any flags, it prompts you to enter information about your project, such as the project name, version, description, entry point, test command, license, and more. By using -y, it automatically accepts the default values for all these prompts and creates a package.json file without user interaction.

2. npm install express mongoose bcryptjs jsonwebtoken dotenv cors body-parser multer paystack-api
npm install: This command installs the specified package(s) into your project. It adds the packages to the node_modules directory and updates the package.json file to include the installed packages as dependencies.
Now let's break down the specific packages being installed:

express: A popular web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing robust features for routing, middleware, and request handling.

mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward way to model application data. Mongoose allows you to define schemas for your data and provides a variety of features such as validation, type casting, and query building.

bcryptjs: A library for hashing and comparing passwords. It is typically used for securely storing user passwords in a database. Bcrypt is designed to be computationally intensive, which helps protect against brute-force attacks.

jsonwebtoken: A library for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWTs are often used for implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms within applications.

dotenv: A module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. It helps manage configuration settings like API keys and database URLs in a secure and organized manner.

cors: A package to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in your Node.js application. CORS is a security feature that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. The cors package helps you configure which origins are allowed to access resources in your application.

body-parser: A middleware that parses incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property. This is particularly useful for parsing form data and JSON payloads.

multer: A middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is used for uploading files. Multer makes it easy to upload files through forms.

paystack-api: A library for interacting with the Paystack payment processing platform. It provides methods to facilitate payment processing and integrates payment functionalities into your application.
